# In Pursuit of That Bar Trivia?

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to connect those brainiac drinkers with local bar trivia nights. A marriage made in AA heaven?

There is a complete rewrite and overhaul in the works currently. The new version is being developed for mobile first using Foundation. The interface is getting much streamlined as well. 

## How it works

Using Google Maps API, it geolocates to your area. Then, using Yelp's API, it finds bars containing "trivia" in their reviews. Currently, the day, time and theme all have to be hardcoded. 

## Future Additions in the Second Version

* will use screen scraping techniques to auto fill the trivia day field
* incorporate a location search bar as well as geolocation
* allow you to send text or email invites to friends
